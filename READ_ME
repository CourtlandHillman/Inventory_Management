roject Description: Inventory Management System

Introduction:
The Inventory Management System is a Java-based application designed to facilitate the management of inventory for businesses or organizations. It provides functionalities for adding, removing, updating, and viewing product information stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Features:

Database Connectivity: The system connects to a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve product information. It utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to establish a connection with the database.
Product Management: Users can perform various operations related to product management, including:
Adding new products to the inventory.
Deleting existing products from the inventory.
Updating product information such as name, quantity, and price.
Viewing a list of all products stored in the inventory.
Exception Handling: The system incorporates robust exception handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and ensure smooth execution of operations.
Technologies Used:

Java: The core programming language used for developing the application.
PostgreSQL: The relational database management system used for storing product information.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): The API used for connecting Java applications with relational databases.
IntelliJ IDEA (or any other Java IDE): The integrated development environment used for coding, testing, and debugging the application.
Project Structure:

InventoryManagementSystem.java: The main class containing the application's entry point and business logic for inventory management.
DatabaseUtils.java: Utility class providing methods for connecting to the PostgreSQL database and executing SQL queries.
Product.java: Class representing a product entity with attributes such as ID, name, quantity, and price.
InventoryManagementSystemTest.java: JUnit test class for testing various functionalities of the Inventory Management System.
Usage:

Clone or download the project from the repository.
Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE.
Set up the PostgreSQL database and configure the database connection parameters in the project.
Run the main class, InventoryManagementSystem.java, to launch the application.
Use the console or UI (if implemented) to interact with the system and perform inventory management operations.
Conclusion:
The Inventory Management System provides a user-friendly interface for managing inventory efficiently. With its robust features and seamless integration with PostgreSQL, it streamlines inventory-related tasks and enhances organizational productivity.
